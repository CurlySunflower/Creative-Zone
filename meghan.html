  <p>  <strong>Let's Start Off With A Little Bit About Me... </strong> </p>
    <p>I am a 2018 Willamette Graduate who majored in Japanese Studies and minored in Psychology.
    Though that combination sounds odd, they actually pair well toegther
    (That's me on the left, and my best friend on the right ^-^).
    Currently I'm living in the city, but for most of my life I have lived on the edge of the countryside.
  I even had singing cows next door! The Jury is still out though on which I prefer.</p>
  <p>Random Fact #1: Frogs are my favorite animal (Their adorableness can't be denied). </p>

  <p><strong>The Adventure So Far...</strong></p>
  <p>I am the type of person who likes to keep taking steps forward,
    even if I am not sure where I am going.
    So in an attempt to find direction and perspective, as well as improve my Japanese, I
    enrolled in <a href="https://www.genkijacs.com/indexjp.htm">Genki JACS</a>,
    a Japanese Language school in <strong>*drumroll*</strong> Fukuoka, Japan.
    They have a great program and if I had the savings I probably would enroll for another year.</p>
    <p>Random Fact #2: I like taking nature and candid photos.  </p>

  <p class=""><strong>What's Around The Corner? </strong></p>
  <p> Things were going really well, but <em>life is life...</em></p>
<p>  Recently I was laid off from my first fulltime job and
  naturally I have a lot of free time now. Rather than wallow though, I'd rather take a step forward,
  so I've started learning how to program. This project is my first project from the course!
  I'm also thinking about exploring the field of early education.
   Afterall, now is the time to explore. <em>Everything is going to be okay.</em>

  <p>Random Fact #3: Sunflowers are my favorite flower.</p>
