  Welcome to <strong>"The Garden" </strong>a text-based story game where you can explore the world known as the "The Garden" and uncover its secrets and your past if you dare.

<em> <p> You are a weary traveler, how long you have been travelling is uncertain. The days and nights bleed together, and your memory is no longer something that can be trusted. After all, day by day more and more of your memories slip away. The only thing you are certain of is your name...and that something awaits you in the West.
  All that's left of your memories is cracked visions, that teeter on the edge of reality. The most sensical of these visions is a grinning masked figure with hollow eyes. He is... unsettling to the say the least. He has yet to speak a word to you, but he keeps pointing you West, all the while clicking his teeth.  At first you tried to ignore him, but the frequency and the horrific nature of the other visions only increased, which made reality even harder to distinguish. You have found that though, as long as you head west, the visions are held at bay.</p>

<p>You remember the first night you finally gave in to his demands. You were on your hands and knees, retching, trying to expel the non-existent blood filling up your lungs. You had finally had enough and cried “Enough! Please! I'll go! "I'll go West!". And like magic, time had seemed to still. You felt a warmth brush your cheek and  his hollow eyes rest upon you in an almost apologetic fashion, as if to say "You'll thank me for this."
 The entirety of that experience had been enough to convince you that heading West was in your best interest, at least for now. Maybe in time you'll understand why hollowed eyes is so adamant you travel west. so far It hasn't been an unpleasant journey. The weather has been fair, there is enough food to scavenge, and the farther west you go, the stronger the smell of sweet flowers permeates the air.
</p><p>  It's sweet and it speaks to something in you long forgotten. You’re not quite sure if that a good or bad thing.
